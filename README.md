# SoT-Actor-Names
A couple of different versions for actor name mapping of SoT actors. Effectively my take at converting
SoT Actor names into the "Friendly" version that we see in the game. 

Two options available:
1) `actors.json` - This is the primary file which I attempted to group together by newline breaks. Each
section may also be sorted from most (top of the section) to least (bottom of the section) valuable.
Using the friendly name for keys and actor name for values.
2) `actors.csv` - CSV version of #1. No separation by types as the csv is generated by `generate_csv.py`


## How Can I Use This?
You are free to use any of these lists in your own development of the ESP Framework: https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-ESP-Framework. The framework 
relies on a conversion mapping, and this simply gives a pre-baked list of conversions for you. If you find an error, please submit a pull 
request/issue for a specific mapping. You may need to perform some slight modification on your end dependant on how
you would like the list to be used. I, for example, have one list for ships, one for treasure, etc. If
you would like to do something similar, you would need to implement that yourself.

## How Do I Find My Own Items to Add?
I personally have a "debug" mode that I can enable, this will enable my ESP to 3D mark all actors with a set of valid coordinates and display
their raw name on the screen. I then determine what the raw name maps to, and create an entry. Alternatively you could just print all nearby
actors and try and parse through the list for what you want to convert. For ordering, I generally
used the SoT Wiki to determine value/rarity, then ordered accordingly.

## Pending Items
Items that we currently do not have a known in-game name for yet:
- Gold Hoarder's Skull
