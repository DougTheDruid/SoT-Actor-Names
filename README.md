# SoT-Actor-Names
A JSON list version of actor name mapping for Sea of Thieves actors

This list is purely my personal list that I use to map in-game actor names to a "friendly" version.
It is not comprehensive, and it might not even be correct in every situation. I personally have associated a
"rarity" score with each item as well, that way I can see the quality of the item in-game. Some values were
determined with the help of https://github.com/igromanru/SoT-SDK-Guide/blob/master/sites/Actors.md, but not
exclusively. Thank you for all of your help SoT Community!

## How Can I Use This?
You are free to use this list in your own development of the ESP Framework: https://github.com/DougTheDruid/SoT-ESP-Framework. The framework 
relies on a conversion mapping, and this simply gives a pre-baked list of conversions for you. If you find an error, please submit a pull 
request/issue for a specific mapping.

## How Do I Add to This List
I personally have a "debug" mode that I can enable, this will enable my ESP to 3D mark all actors with a set of valid coordinates and display
their raw name on the screen. I then determine what the raw name maps to, and create an entry. Alternatively you could just print all nearby
actors and try and parse through the list for what you want to convert.
